I spent time looking at different portfolio websites to gain inspiration and to identify the design elements and features that I wanted to include in my own website.

<h1>Background</h1>
<h1>
My audience for this portfolio website is primarily potential employers in the field of computer science or related industries. I am targeting individuals or companies that are looking to hire a software developer or a computer science graduate. The website is designed to showcase my skills, qualifications, and experience in a professional and polished manner, and to demonstrate my passion and commitment to the field of computer science. Additionally, I also target to be a resource for students or anyone who is interested in the field of computer science, as it provides a glimpse of what a successful computer scientist has to offer.

"https://www.behance.net/": I looked at Behance when creating my portfolio website. I was impressed by the variety of portfolio projects and the high level of quality in the work showcased. I appreciated the ability to filter projects by industry and the option to save and organize projects I liked. I also liked the clean, user-friendly design of the website.

"https://www.dribbble.com/": Dribbble was another online portfolio resource that I looked at. I liked the focus on visual design and the ability to see different stages of a project's development. I also appreciated the option to follow and interact with other designers.

"https://www.carriecousins.com/": I came across Carrie Cousins's portfolio website and I was impressed by the clean, minimalistic design and the way she highlighted her work experience and skills. I liked the way she used images and videos to showcase her work and the way she divided her work into different categories.

I referred to "https://www.canva.com/learn/how-to-create-a-portfolio/" as a resource to create my online portfolio. It provided me with a step by step guide on how to create an online portfolio, including ideas for design and layout, tips for showcasing your work, and advice on how to make your portfolio stand out. The website also provided helpful templates and examples to get me started on my portfolio website.

<h1>Planning</h1>

<h1> I have ensured accessibility for my website through 3 ways: 
    Keyboard navigation: I have made sure that my website can be navigated using only the keyboard, without a mouse. This makes it more accessible for users with mobility impairments.
    
    I have also added descriptive sub-titles to all pages on the website, which helps users to quickly understand the content of each page.
    
    Color contrast: I have ensured that the color contrast between text and background is at least 4.5:1 for all text on my website. This makes it easier for users with visual impairments to read the text.
    </h1>

<h1> To make the website easy to use or navigate, I have created a clear and consistent navigation menu, which makes it easy for users to find the information they need. The menu is located in the same place on every page and it's easy to identify it by its design and color. Additionally, I have made sure that all the links on the website are clear and self-explanatory, so users can easily understand where they are going to be directed to.
 </h1>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<h1>
    I had to research which libraries, plugins, and resources I wanted to use to create the portfolio website. I found the information by looking at examples of other portfolio websites and reading tutorials online. I took the examples as inspiration and modified them to fit my own needs. I ended up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JavaScript libraries such as Fetch API to create the website.

<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<h1>3 things that worked well were the design: I believe the design of the website worked particularly well. It was clean, modern, and visually appealing, which helped to showcase my skills and qualifications in a professional and polished manner.

    Content: I think that the content of my website was well-organized and easy to read, which made it easy for users to find the information they were looking for.
    
    Accessibility: I think that the accessibility features that I included on my website worked well. The text alternatives, color contrast, and keyboard navigation made it more accessible for users with disabilities.
    3 things to be improved were optimization: I think that the website might be improved by optimizing the images to make the website load faster.Responsiveness: I believe that the website might be improved by making it more responsive, so that it looks good on different devices and screen sizes.
    Interactivity: I think that the website might be improved by adding more interactive elements, such as quizzes, and interactive maps, which would make it more engaging and interactive.
    
    If I had more time, I would optimize the images to make the website load faster. I would also make the website more responsive by using CSS media queries. Finally, I would add more interactive elements to make the website more engaging and interactive for the users.
